## TODO

- [ ] Improve responsiveness during long operations
   - [x] Add progress bars
   - [x] Run them in a separate thread and avoid freezing the main application
   - [x] Send texture data to GL in smaller tiles, across several re-draws to avoid stalling main app
   - [ ] Allow canceling/aborting long operations
- [ ] Refactor Color3 and Color4 classes as subclasses of Eigen Matrices, so we can more easily do color conversion.
- [x] Add log-linear and log-log histogram options?
- [ ] Improved DNG/demosaicing pipeline
   - [ ] Improve DNG color correction
   - [ ] Allow skipping DNG demosaicing during load
   - [ ] Add demosaicing/color correction/white balancing post-load filters
   - [ ] Will require storing DNG metadata to apply correct color-correction matrix
- [x] Selection support
- [ ] More image filters/transformations/adjustments 
   - [x] Canvas size/cropping
   - [ ] White balance adjustment
   - [x] Brightness/contrast
   - [ ] Luminance/chromaticity denoising 
   - [ ] Levels
   - [x] Hue/Saturation
   - [x] Convert to grayscale/desaturate
   - [x] Invert
   - [ ] Equalize/normalize histogram
   - [ ] Match color/histogram matching
   - [ ] FFT-based convolution/blur
   - [ ] Motion blur
   - [x] Merge down/flatten layers
- [ ] Enable processing/filtering images passed on command-line even in GUI mode (e.g. load many images, blur them, and then display them in the GUI, possibly without saving)
- [ ] HDR merging
- [ ] HDR tonemapping
- [x] General image editing
   - [x] Clone stamp
   - [x] Airbrush
   - [x] Cropping
- [ ] GUI improvements
   - [x] Add support for resizing side panel
   - [ ] Allow error logging to output to a debug status panel in the GUI.
   - [x] Improved drop-down menus
   - [x] Save all
   - [x] Close all
   - [ ] Show command history and allow undoing/redoing multiple steps at once
